
Sure, here's a template that displays the information you mentioned for the invoice and recovery:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Finalized Transaction</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Finalized Transaction</h1>

    <h2>Invoice Information</h2>
    <p>Customer: {{ invoice.customer }}</p>
    <p>Routing: {{ invoice.routing }}</p>
    <p>Date: {{ invoice.date }}</p>
    <p>Total Amount: {{ invoice.total_amount }}</p>

    <h2>Recovery Information</h2>
    <p>Amount Received: {{ recovery.amount_received }}</p>
    <p>Received Date: {{ recovery.received_date }}</p>
    <p>Balance: {{ recovery.balance }}</p>
    <p>Previous Balance: {{ recovery.previous_balance }}</p>
</body>
</html>
